This application enables the transcription of the Petrie Museum's archive of pocket diaries kept by the well-known 
Egyptian archaeologist, Sir Flinders Petrie. This one cover the years 1884 - 1885 and records which sites he was 
working on, when and who he met with. 

We also get to see when he is buying antiquities as well as excavating them helping us understand his collecting habits. 
By helping Alice Stevenson and Paolo Delvesco transcibe these diaries, you will enable many new uses for these data (including 
feeding the Petrie Bot built by Shawn Graham).

Images will be drawn from the Petrie Museum's Flickr feed and redisplayed in the browser window. We would like help in 
assigning each daily entry in the diary its proper date and then with transcribing the often challenges handwriting for 
each entry.

This application should be a very straightforward and will contribute to an overall goal of transcribing the full set of 
Flinders Petrie's diaries, covering his life from 1880-1940.
