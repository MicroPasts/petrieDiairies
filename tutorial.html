                <p>
                    This is a very simple application for the crowd-sourcing of data from Sir Flinders Petrie's field
                    diary for 1884 - 1885. This project is on behalf of the Petrie Museum, University College London.
                    transcribe. Within this project, all we need is the daily entries to be transcribed for the appropriate
                    day within each diary page. The biggest challenge for you, is to decipher Sir Flinders Petrie's
                    handwriting! However there is a caveat for this task.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Flinders Petrie was infamously frugal. He only had one pocket diary for each excavation season.
                    A season started in late Autumn/early Winter (October or November) which is when he would start a 'new diary'.
                    So for 1883-1884 he used an 1884 diary and merely changed the date of entries for the 1883 months and
                    carried on using the same diary.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For each page of the diary, only 4 entries are entered per page. We would like you to capture 2 things
                    for each entry:
                <ol>
                    <li>Date of entry (falls within either 1884 or 1885)</li>
                    <li>The text for each entry</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    That seems simple!
                </p>
            </div>

            <div id="2" class="modal-body" style="display:none">
                <p>
                    Dates are entered in the format dd/mm/yyyy and to assist you, a simple javascript powered date picker
                    has been incorporated. To activate this, click on the icon as shown in the image below:
                </p>

                <p>
                    This brings up an overlay window such as the below. Click on the month and then the day:
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once activated, choose the year, month and date for the appropriate entry. Then in the text box below
                    enter your transcription of Sir Flinders' handwriting. Hopefully you can read it!
                </p>
            </div>

            <div id="3" class="modal-body" style="display:none">
                <p>
                    Finally, after repeating the process 4 times, you may have comments on the page. Maybe other text,
                    general comment, etc. If you do just enter it into the comments box. If you find it hard to decipher a
                    word, then use the notation below for text:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        [...]
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                   And if it is a name you cannot work out:
                </p>
                 <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        [name?]
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
            </div>
